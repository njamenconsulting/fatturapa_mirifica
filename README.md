# Fattura-mirifica

## About

This application firstly allows you to generate an invoice in XML format from the data filled in a form. Then send the generated invoice (XML file) by email.

## Contributing

We have used [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework to build this app.

To fill out form and seed database with fake data, we use a PHP library named [Faker](https://github.com/FakerPHP/Faker/).
